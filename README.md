# MetalTemplate

## Janie Clayton

This is a template I created to accompany my post on [my blog](http://redqueencoder.com).

This is fully updated to Swift 2 and iOS 9. I will do my best to keep this up to date.

**Note:** You need a device with at least an A7 chip to build to as Metal code does not build in the Xcode simulator.
